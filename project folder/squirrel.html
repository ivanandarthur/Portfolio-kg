    <h1>Squirrel Away</h1>
    <h3>is a fictional app that empowers
      people to achieve savings for a special objective.</h3>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>This project began with a competitive analysis, examining a plethora of
      savings applications including traditional banks, large and popular
      money-managing platforms such as Mint and Dobot, as well as many
      smaller savings apps available for mobile devices. Squirrel Away has
      been kept to one specific purpose: keep an eye on where the money is going in order to save for a particular goal.</p>
    <p>Squirrel Awayâ€™s logo and mascot is the industrious rodent who always
      remains steadfast, busily preparing every day to ensure goals are met.</p>

    <p>Our palette consists of a vibrant triad of gold, purple, and green, representing wealth, luxury, and money.</p>

      through linking a bank account, setting a goal, a deadline, and goal dollar
      amount. Once confirmed, the user can see an overview of their spending,
      income, and savings.</p>
